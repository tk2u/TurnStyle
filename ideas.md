Consider using outlines of clothing types (rather than photos),
perhaps hand-drawn sketches or something like
https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/clothes-outline
.

Consider using zoomed-in photos of fabric types
(detailed enough to see thread patterns).


Is there a way to get a rough draft of
all the clothes in a closet
into the app database
from a few photos
of the "sides" of the clothes
as they are hanging in the closet?
At least to distinguish "tops" from "bottoms"
and approximate colors.
